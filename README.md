It's a simple quote search app using JavaScript.
It fetches quotes from the DummyJSON API and lets the user search by typing any string.
The quotes are shown in a list, and as the user type, it filters the results in real time.

If the API doesn't work, the app shows an error message. And if the searched word has no results, 
it will show *No results* message.

The project was built using:

HTML
simple CSS
JavaScript

It's created for the JavaScript Coding Assessment for the code2career by GSG.
